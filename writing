I am writing to inform you that I have submitted the necessary documentation to report and register my Traffic Data Analyst Internship with Hennepin County's Transportation Department as part of my academic requirements at Saint Cloud State University.
As part of this process, you will soon receive an email from Handshake (notifications@joinhandshake.com or handshake@m.joinhandshake.com), the universityâ€™s career and experience tracking system. This email will request your approval for my participation in the internship. Please note that the email is not spam, and your prompt review and approval would be greatly appreciated.
